## Getting Started

This code can directly inputted into your on your local machine to produce the resulting html and images . See section below on how to replicated this project in RStudio.

### Prerequisites

These are the packages you need to install as well the installation process 

```
instal.packages(magrittr) 
install.packages(janitor) 
install.packages(scales) 
install.packages(ballr)
install.packages(knitr)
install.packages(shiny)
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
install.packages(ggplot2)
install.packages(ggthemes)
=======
>>>>>>> e614257b69a973feb8ff0afeb3d72683b011ef25
=======
install.packages(ggplot2)
install.packages(ggthemes)
>>>>>>> dd70c878c29af9a42e848d47ada8293d2241693a
```

### Installing

Once these packages and the necessary dependencies have been installed called this libraries in your console 

```
library (magrittr) 
library (janitor) 
library (scales) 
library(ballr)
library(knitr)
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
=======
>>>>>>> e614257b69a973feb8ff0afeb3d72683b011ef25
=======
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
>>>>>>> dd70c878c29af9a42e848d47ada8293d2241693a
```

And use the shiny package when running the shiny html

```
library(shiny)

```

Will be able to recreate both html documents.
