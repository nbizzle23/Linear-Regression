```
instal.packages(magrittr) 
install.packages( (janitor) 
install.packages( (scales) 
install.packages((ballr)
install.packages((knitr)
install.packages(shiny)
install.packages(ggplot2)
install.packages(ggthemes)
```

### Installing

Once these packages and the necessary dependencies have been installed called this libraries in your console 

```
library (magrittr) 
library (janitor) 
library (scales) 
library(ballr)
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
```

And use the shiny package when running the shiny html

```
